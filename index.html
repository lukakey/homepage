 <strong>Research Interests:</strong> Mathematical Logic and Theory of Computation
<br></br>
I am broadly interested in mathematical logic and the theory of computation. Recently, I focus on the intersection of logic and complexity.
<br>
I am a postgraudate student in the Mathematics and Foundation of Computer Science(MFoCS) at Oxford University. I received my bachelor degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
<br></br>
At the undergraduate level, I was advised by Prof.Xingwu Liu from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, working on combinatorics problems.
